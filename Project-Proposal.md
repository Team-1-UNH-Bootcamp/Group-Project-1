## Project Name

Working Title:

Covid 19 Symptoms Tracker

## Project Description

In a few sentences, describe the following:

1. Who the audience is of this application
   This app targets New Hampshire employers. As dictated by New Hampshire's guidelines for re-opening businesses, employers are required to monitor and track their employees' symptoms in order to screen for potential cases of the Coronavirus.

2. What the goal of this application is
   Our app aims to provide an easy to use solution for monitoring both employee health and providing in-real-time updates on Coronavirus news and statistics.

3. How is this application used
   New Hampshire has provided a list of symptoms employers should monitor thier employees for. We will turn this to a questionaire that will help employees track the employee health. The app will also use multiple APIs to pull news and information pretaining to Covid. This will help employers stay current on the important data and news they need to operate their business safely.

## Group Leader

You must choose amongst your group who the leader is, the leader's additional responsibilities are:

## Manage the GitHub repo for the project

Ensure everyone is completing their work
Aid in distributing work fairly among teammates
Facilitate group calls and zoom meetings
Filling out this proposal document and providing it to the instructional staff

The group leader is not just a project manager, it is expected for them to directly contribute to the project code as well.

## Team Members

List out your team members and their roles here. You may choose not to define roles for team members
and that is okay, but if your team has designated specific members for HTML, Design, JS, API work, etc. You can note that

As a group, we decided that it'd be best to assess our code first and assign specific tasks as necessary to complete the assignment. We think that the HTML and Design are going to be an easier task than the JS and API work. As such, we're going to initiate the JS and API work together, and, assess as needed.

## Communication Considerations

Below are some things you'll want to consider and discuss with your group. If you would like
you can fill out each item and include it in the proposal as a sort of "contract" for your team.

How often will you hold meetings? How long?
We will be using our in-class meetings as a barometer to see whether or not extra meetings are needed. If we feel that additional meetings are needed outside of class, we will schedule a meeting to address specific issues as they arise.

How will you keep track of tasks? (Consider applications like Trello or GitHub Projects)
We are going to use GitHub Projects

What if someone misses a deadline?
If someone is concerned that they are going to miss a deadline, the first thing to do is alert the team and let them know. Next, as a group, we will assess the situation and provide assistance as best we can. From there, we will set up a time for that member to receive the help they need to complete the assignment.

What happens if someone misses a meeting? What is their responsibility?

1. Check in with the group leader to get the pertinent information discussed in the meeting.
2. Check the GitHub projects page to see if there are any new assignments.
3. Take a look at the assignment and reach out to other group members for assistance as needed

What is the team's responsibility?
To work together as a team to complete the app. To communicate openly with one another and ask for help, if help is needed.

How does each team member like to receive feedback?
Our team likes a collaborative and direct approach to feedback. I think we all understand that we are very much entry-level coders. We think the best way to approach feedback is to present it as a learning opportunity.

What if there is friction between members? How will you address it?
The issue that is most important to us is no ghosting! We will try and use friction points as an opportunity to collaborate and improve. If group members are struggling, we will assess the situation and collectively come up with a plan for moving forward that eases tension and promotes a constructive solution.

Are there any other agreements you have made as a team, if so what?
We really want to make sure that each member gets practice with each element of coding the app. This is way we are taking a more collective approach.
